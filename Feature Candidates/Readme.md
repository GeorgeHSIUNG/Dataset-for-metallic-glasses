The elemental parameters were based on the following elemental propertiesfrom experiments or density functional theory (DFT) simulations.

them were calculated from the elemental properties based on the linear-mixture rule(x1) and the reciprocal mixture rule (x2), and their deviation (xD) and discrepancy (xd) were also calculated with following Eqs.
