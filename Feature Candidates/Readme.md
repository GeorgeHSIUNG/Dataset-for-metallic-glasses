***Elemental Parameters*** were based on the following elemental properties from experiments or density functional theory (DFT) simulations.

Them were calculated from the elemental properties based on the linear-mixture rule(x1) and the reciprocal mixture rule (x2), and their deviation (xD) and discrepancy (xd) were also calculated with following Eqs.

***Thermodynamic Parameters*** reflect the driving force for glass transformation, and these parameters are defined in the equations below

***Valence Electron Distributions*** comprised the number (sVEC, pVEC, dVEC) and the fraction (fs, fp, fd) of electrons in the s, p, d valence orbitals of an element, based on the linear mixture rule

***Average Atomic Volume*** was constructed to predict the bulk modulus which may affect the GFA
